<p>This finding informs you that an API operation was invoked from an IP address that is included on a threat list that you uploaded. The threat list associated with this finding is listed in 
the <strong>Additional Information</strong> section of a finding&#39;s details. The API observed is commonly associated with the credential access tactics where an adversary is attempting to 
collect passwords, usernames, and access keys for your Kubernetes cluster. </p>
<p><strong>Remediation recommendations:</strong></p>
<p>If the user reported in the finding under the <code>KubernetesUserDetails</code> section is <code>system:anonymous</code>, investigate why the anonymous user was permitted to invoke the API 
and <a href="https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/iam/#review-and-revoke-unnecessary-anonymous-access">revoke the permissions</a> if needed. If the user is an

finding could represent expected activity for your environment. If this is the case in your AWS environment, we recommend that you set up a suppression rule for this finding. The suppression 
rule should consist of two filter criteria. The first filter criterion should use the <strong>Finding type</strong> attribute with a value of <code>CryptoCurrency:Runtime/BitcoinTool.B</code>. 
The second filter criterion should be the <strong>Instance ID</strong> of the instance or the <strong>Container Image ID</strong> of the container involved in cryptocurrency or 
blockchain-related activity. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/findings_suppression-rule.html">Suppression rules</a>.</p>

<p>This finding informs you that a Tor exit node IP address probed an RDS database in your AWS environment, though no login attempt was made. This may indicate that a potentially malicious 
actor is attempting to scan for publicly accessible infrastructure. Tor is a software for enabling anonymous communication. It encrypts and randmonly bounces communications through relays 
between a series of network nodes. The last Tor node is called the exit node. This can indicate unauthorized access to the RDS resources in your account, with the intent of hiding the 
potentially malicious actor&#39;s true identity.</p>
<p><strong>Remediation recommendations:</strong></p>
<p>If this activity is unexpected for the associated database, it may indicate that there is an overly permissive access policy to the database or the database is publicly exposed. It is 
recommended to place the database in a private VPC, and limit the security group rules to allow traffic only from the necessary sources. For more information, see <a

<li><strong>Data source:</strong> CloudTrail data events for S3</li>
</ul>
<p>This finding informs you that an IAM entity has invoked an S3 API to discover S3 buckets in your environment, such as <code>ListObjects</code>. This type of activity is associated with the 
discovery stage of an attack wherein an attacker gathers information to determine if your AWS environment is susceptible to a broader attack. This activity is suspicious because the IAM entity 
invoked the API in an unusual way. For example, an IAM entity with no previous history invokes an S3 API, or an IAM entity invokes an S3 API from an unusual location. </p>
<p>This API was identified as anomalous by GuardDuty&#39;s anomaly detection machine learning (ML) model. The ML model evaluates all the API requests in your account and identifies anomalous 
events that are associated with techniques used by adversaries. It tracks various factors of the API requests, such as the user who made the request, the location from which the request was 
made, the specific API that was requested, the bucket that was requested, and the number of API calls made. For more information on which factors of the API request are unusual for the user

<p>This finding informs you that the listed Amazon EC2 instance within your AWS environment is querying a low reputation domain name associated with known abused domains or IP addresses. 
Examples of abused domains are top level domain names (TLDs) and second-level domain names (2LDs) providing free subdomain registrations as well as dynamic DNS providers. Threat actors tend to 
use these services to register domains for free or at low costs. Low reputation domains in this category may also be expired domains resolving to a registrar&#39;s parking IP address and 
therefore may no longer be active. A parking IP is where a registrar directs traffic for domains that have not been linked to any service. The listed Amazon EC2 instance may be compromised as 
threat actors commonly use these registrar&#39;s or services for C&amp;C and malware distribution.</p>
<p>Low reputation domains are based on a reputation score model. This model evaluates and ranks the characteristics of a domain to determine its likelihood of being malicious.</p>

<p><strong>Default severity: Medium</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data source:</strong> CloudTrail data events for S3</li>
</ul>
<p>This finding informs you that an IAM entity in your AWS environment is making API calls that involve an S3 bucket, and this behavior differs from that entity&#39;s established baseline. The 
API call used in this activity is associated with an attack that attempts to write data. This activity is suspicious because the IAM entity invoked the API in an unusual way. For example, an 
IAM entity with no previous history invokes an S3 API, or an IAM entity invokes an S3 API from an unusual location.</p>
<p>This API was identified as anomalous by GuardDuty&#39;s anomaly detection machine learning (ML) model. The ML model evaluates all the API requests in your account and identifies anomalous 
events that are associated with techniques used by adversaries. It tracks various factors of the API requests, such as the user who made the request, the location from which the request was 
made, the specific API that was requested, the bucket that was requested, and the number of API calls made. For more information on which factors of the API request are unusual for the user 
identity that invoked the request, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_findings-summary.html#finding-anomalous">Finding details</a>.</p>

<p>This finding informs you that the default service account for a namespace in your Kubernetes cluster was granted admin privileges. Kubernetes creates a default service account for all the 
namespaces in the cluster. It automatically assigns the default service account as an identity to pods that have not been explicitly associated to another service account. If the default

that your credentials are compromised. </p>
<p><strong>Remediation recommendations:</strong></p>
<p>You should not use the default service account to grant permissions to pods. Instead you should create a dedicated service account for each workload and grant permission to that account on 
a needs basis. To fix this issue, you should create dedicated service accounts for all your pods and workloads and update the pods and workloads to migrate from the default service account to 
their dedicated accounts. Then you should remove the admin permission from the default service account. See <a

<p>This finding informs you that the host runC binary file has been potentially overwritten. runC is the low-level container runtime that high-level container runtimes, such as Docker and 
Containerd, use to spawn and run containers. runC is always executed with root privileges because it needs to perform a low-level task of creating a container. A well-known vulnerability (<a

<p>Typically, page faults are handled by the kernel in kernel space. However, <code>userfaultfd</code> system call allows a process to handle page faults on a filesystem in user space. This is 
a useful feature that enables implementation of user-space filesystems. On the other hand, it can also be used by a potentially malicious process to interrupt kernel from user space. 
Interrupting kernel by using <code>userfaultfd</code> system call is a common exploitation technique to extend race windows during exploitation of kernel race conditions. Use of 
<code>userfaultfd</code> may indicate suspicious activity on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance.</p>

<h3 id="account-password-policy-was-weakened-">Account password policy was weakened.</h3>
<p><strong>Default severity: Low*</strong></p>
<h6 id="note">Note</h6>
<p>This finding&#39;s severity can be Low, Medium, or High depending on the severity of the changes made to password policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data source:</strong> CloudTrail management events</li>
</ul>
<p>The AWS account password policy was weakened on the listed account within your AWS environment. For example, it was deleted or updated to require fewer characters, not require symbols and 
numbers, or required to extend the password expiration period. This finding can also be triggered by an attempt to update or delete your AWS account password policy. The AWS account password 
policy defines the rules that govern what kinds of passwords can be set for your IAM users. A weaker password policy permits the creation of passwords that are easy to remember and potentially 
easier to guess, thereby creating a security risk.</p>

<p><strong>Default severity: Low</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data source:</strong> CloudTrail management events</li>
</ul>
<p>This finding informs you that S3 server access logging is disabled for a bucket within your AWS environment. If disabled, no web request logs are created for any attempts to access the 
identified S3 bucket, however, S3 management API calls to the bucket, such as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucket.html">DeleteBucket</a>, are still 
tracked. If S3 data event logging is enabled through CloudTrail for this bucket, web requests for objects within the bucket will still be tracked. Disabling logging is a technique used by 
unauthorized users in order to evade detection. To learn more about S3 logs, see  <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html">S3 Server Access Logging</a> and <a

<p>This finding informs you that the listed EC2 instance in your AWS environment is trying to query domain generation algorithm (DGA) domains. Your EC2 instance might be compromised.</p>
<p>DGAs are used to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used as rendezvous points with their command and control (C&amp;C) servers. Command and control servers are 
computers that issue commands to members of a botnet, which is a collection of internet-connected devices that are infected and controlled by a common type of malware. The large number of 
potential rendezvous points makes it difficult to effectively shut down botnets because infected computers attempt to contact some of these domain names every day to receive updates or

<p>This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment is communicating with an IP address included on a threat list that you uploaded. In GuardDuty, a threat list consists 
of known malicious IP addresses. GuardDuty generates findings based on uploaded threat lists. The threat list used to generate this finding will be listed in the finding&#39;s details.</p>

</ul>
<p>This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment is querying a domain that resolves to the EC2 metadata IP address (169.254.169.254). A DNS query of this kind may 
indicate that the instance is a target of a DNS rebinding technique. This technique can be used to obtain metadata from an EC2 instance, including the IAM credentials associated with the 
instance.</p>
<p>DNS rebinding involves tricking an application running on the EC2 instance to load return data from a URL, where the domain name in the URL resolves to the EC2 metadata IP address 
(169.254.169.254). This causes the application to access EC2 metadata and possibly make it available to the attacker. </p>
<p>It is possible to access EC2 metadata using DNS rebinding only if the EC2 instance is running a vulnerable application that allows injection of URLs, or if someone accesses the URL in a web 
browser running on the EC2 instance.</p>
<p><strong>Remediation recommendations:</strong></p>
<p>In response to this finding, you should evaluate if there is a vulnerable application running on the EC2 instance, or if someone used a browser to access the domain identified in the 
finding. If the root cause is a vulnerable application, you should fix the vulnerability. If someone browsed the identified domain, you should block the domain or prevent users from accessing 
it. If you determine this finding was related to either case above, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_revoke-sessions.html">revoke the session associated 
with the EC2 instance</a>.</p>
<p>Some AWS customers intentionally map the metadata IP address to a domain name on their authoritative DNS servers. If this is the case in your environment, we recommend that you set up a 
suppression rule for this finding. The suppression rule should consist of two filter criteria. The first criteria should use the <strong>Finding type</strong> attribute with a value of 
<code>UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/MetaDataDNSRebind</code>. The second filter criteria should be <strong>DNS request domain</strong> and the value should match the domain you have mapped to the

<p><strong>Remediation recommendations:</strong></p>
<p>In response to this finding you can use the following workflow to determine a course of action:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the remote account involved from the <code>service.action.awsApiCallAction.remoteAccountDetails.accountId</code> field.<ol>
<li>Next determine if that account is affiliated with your GuardDuty environment from the <code>service.action.awsApiCallAction.remoteAccountDetails.affiliated</code> field.</li>
<li>If the account is affiliated, contact the remote account owner, and the owner of the EC2 instance credentials to investigate.</li>
<li>If the account is not affiliated, first evaluate is that account is associated with your organization but is not a part of your GuardDuty multi-account set up, or if GuardDuty has not yet 
been enabled in the account. Otherwise contact the owner of the EC2 credentials to determine if there is a use case for a remote account to use these credentials.</li>
<li>If the owner of the credentials does not recognize the remote account the credentials may have been compromised by a threat actor operating within AWS. You should take the steps 
recommended in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_remediate.html#compromised-ec2">Remediating a compromised Amazon EC2 instance</a> to secure your environment. 
Additionally you can <a href="https://support.aws.amazon.com/#/contacts/report-abuse">submit an abuse report</a> to the AWS Trust and Safety team to begin an investigation into the remote

<p>This finding informs you that an EC2 instance or a container in your AWS environment is making connections to a Tor Guard or an Authority node. Tor is software for enabling anonymous 
communication. Tor Guards and Authority nodes act as initial gateways into a Tor network. This traffic can indicate that this EC2 instance or the container has been potentially compromised and 
is acting as a client on a Tor network. This finding may indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources with the intent of hiding the attacker&#39;s true identity.</p>
<p>The runtime agent monitors events from multiple resource types. To identify the potentially compromised resource, view <strong>Resource type</strong> in the findings panel in the GuardDuty 
console.</p>

<li><strong>Feature:</strong> Runtime Monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p>This finding informs you that an EC2 instance or a container in your AWS environment is making connections to a Tor network in a manner that suggests that it&#39;s acting as a Tor relay. 
Tor is software for enabling anonymous communication. Tor increases anonymity of communication by forwarding the client&#39;s possibly illicit traffic from one Tor relay to another.</p>

<p>This finding informs you that an S3 API operation, such as <code>PutObject</code> or <code>PutObjectAcl</code>, was invoked from a Tor exit node IP address. Tor is software for enabling 
anonymous communication. It encrypts and randomly bounces communications through relays between a series of network nodes. The last Tor node is called the exit node. This finding can indicate 
unauthorized access to your AWS resources with the intent of hiding the attacker&#39;s true identity.</p>
